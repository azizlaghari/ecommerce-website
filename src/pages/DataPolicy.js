                        <h5>Protection of personal data</h5>
                        <p>
                            Legislation requires that your personal information be stored securely and confidentially. We store your personal information on high-security servers located in controlled facilities, and our security is regularly checked to determine whether user information is handled securely, always with strict regard to your rights as a user. However, we cannot guarantee 100% security of data transmissions over the Internet. This means that there may be a risk that other unauthorized parties gain access to information when data is sent and stored electronically. You thereby send your personal information at your own risk.
                            <br />
                            Personal information is deleted or anonymized when the purpose for which it was collected ceases. The rapid development of the Internet means that it may sometimes be necessary to change our processing of personal data. We therefore reserve the right to update and change these guidelines for the processing of personnel data. If we do this, we will of course correct the &quot;last updated&quot; date at the bottom of the web page. In case of substantial changes, we will notify you with a visible notice on our websites.
                            <br />
                            You have the right to complain about the processing of information and data concerning you. Complaints are sent to the Data Protection Authority.
